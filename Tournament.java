 * The Tournament class represents the tournament that is being played. 
 * The tournament class contains the name of the tournament,
 *  Team class instances (which represent each team), an array of matches to be played 
 *  (which acts like our main data structure) 
 *  and specific instances of the Team class which represent the champion, runner-up and the third place holder.
 *  This class is responsible for taking in the input from the file, seeding and storing it in the main data structure.
 *  The seeding algorithm taken from online source
